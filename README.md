# LESbrary.jl

This package is a framework for building a library of large eddy simulations (LES) of ocean surface boundary layer turbulence — the _LESbrary_ — with [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl). The LESbrary will archive turbulence data for both idealized and realistic oceanic scenarios.

## Adding LESbrary.jl to a julia environment

To add `LESbrary.jl` to your julia environment, type

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/CliMA/LESbrary.jl.git")
```

at the REPL. This will allow you to write `using LESbrary` in your scripts (and thereby run the scripts in `/examples`).
